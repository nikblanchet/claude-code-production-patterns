# Technical Documentation and Content Engineer, Claude Code Take Home

## Intro

This take-home assignment is designed to assess your skills in technical writing, developer education, and your deep understanding of Claude Code workflows and best practices. You'll be creating a comprehensive documentation package that addresses one of Claude Code's most challenging implementation areas.

If you decide to put in more than 6 hours on this take-home assignment, please clearly note the content that was created before the 6-hour mark. If helpful, feel free to add notes in places where if you had more time, you'd want to elaborate or build more in a specific area. Feel free to use summarizing techniques like bullet point lists too, if it helps to keep your answer concise.

**Note:** You are encouraged to use Claude to help you in any way you would like, as one of the role's core responsibilities is to better integrate Claude into content creation workflows. You will not be assessed by how much or how little you use Claude, but rather by the quality of your final set of submitted materials (and of any placeholder summaries that you would further expand given more time). If you do decide to use Claude, explaining how you use Claude can only help, not harm, your application. To that end, **please document your use of Claude and include the entire transcript of your Claude Code, Claude.ai, and other Claude conversations. If the transcript does not comprehensively cover all the ways you used Claude, please include all relevant content.**

## Background

Claude Code represents a revolutionary approach to AI-assisted development, enabling developers to delegate complex coding tasks directly from their terminal. While basic Claude Code usage is documented, advanced workflow optimization and enterprise deployment scenarios remain challenging areas where developers need comprehensive guidance.

## Scenarios

**Choose ONE of the following scenarios that best aligns with your hands-on Claude Code experience.** In your submission, briefly explain (2-3 sentences) why you selected this scenario and what specific experience qualifies you to tackle it effectively.

### Scenario A: Claude Code Context Management for Large Codebases

Enterprise developers working with large, complex codebases face unique challenges when using Claude Code effectively. This scenario focuses on optimizing context management, file organization strategies, and workflow patterns for codebases with thousands of files across multiple languages and frameworks.

**Your task:** Create a documentation package for using Claude Code effectively on enterprise-scale projects (100k+ lines of code), including context optimization strategies, dependency mapping techniques, and multi-language project management approaches. Your documentation package must include sample implementation code that you think best demonstrates these concepts.

### Scenario B: Claude Code SDK Advanced Use Cases

Claude Code's SDK enables programmatic integration and automation beyond the command-line interface. This scenario focuses on building sophisticated applications and workflows using the Claude Code SDK for custom development tools, automated code generation pipelines, and integration with existing development infrastructure.

**Your task:** Create a documentation package for advanced Claude Code SDK usage, covering programmatic integration patterns, custom tooling development, and workflows that extend Claude Code's capabilities within other development environments. Your documentation package must include sample implementation code that you think best demonstrates these concepts.

### Scenario C: Claude Code Agents and Hooks - Advanced Integration Patterns

Claude Code's agents and hooks commands enable sophisticated development workflows that go beyond basic code generation. This scenario focuses on building custom agents, implementing advanced hooks, and creating reusable patterns for complex development scenarios.

**Your task:** Create a documentation package for advanced Claude Code agents and hooks commands covering custom agent creation, hooks that power complex workflows, and patterns for building sophisticated AI-assisted development workflows. Your documentation package must include sample implementation code that you think best demonstrates these concepts.

## Submission Requirements

### Submission Format

- **Scenario and choice justification:** Your chosen scenario, and 2-3 sentences explaining why you chose your scenario and any relevant experience related to that scenario
- **Planning document:** Brief outline of your documentation strategy (see Recommended Approach: Phase 1)
- **Documentation package** (see Documentation Package Requirements):
  - **Main documentation:** Comprehensive guide in your preferred format
  - **GitHub repository:** Working implementation with code samples, configuration files, and technical demonstrations

### Documentation Package Requirements

Your documentation package should include two parts:

1. **A comprehensive documentation guide** that covers the advanced concepts, implementation patterns, and best practices for your chosen scenario

2. **A working technical implementation** (code samples, configuration files, or reference implementation) that demonstrates these concepts in action and includes:
   a. Functional code samples that can be executed and tested (not just snippets)
   b. Clear examples showing both successful patterns and common pitfalls
   c. Practical demonstrations of the workflows you're documenting
   d. Your implementation should go beyond basic examples to demonstrate sophisticated workflow patterns, including proper error handling, performance considerations, and, if applicable, agent architecture and context management decisions that others can learn from and adapt.

The documentation should be structured to help experienced developers successfully implement your chosen scenario in their development workflows. Consider including:

- **Workflow overview:** High-level process patterns and decision frameworks
- **Implementation guide:** Step-by-step technical implementation with practical examples
- **Best practices:** Context management, prompting strategies, and optimization techniques
- **Troubleshooting guide:** Common issues and resolution approaches
- **Measurement strategies:** How to evaluate effectiveness and optimize workflows

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Planning

Write a brief outline of your documentation strategy for your chosen scenario. This outline should include both what content you're creating, as well as why. Some things to consider:

- **Success criteria:** How will you know you've created truly helpful content for developers working with advanced Claude Code workflows?
- **Developer needs analysis:** What does a developer need to know to make intelligent decisions about implementing your scenario?
- **Content structure:** Plan and rationale for organizing your documentation and technical materials
- **Implementation approach:** What technical demonstrations will best illustrate the concepts?
- **Workflow optimization:** How will you address the gap between basic usage and advanced optimization?
- **Technical depth assessment:** What level of implementation detail will convince an experienced developer that your approach is sound?
- **Code architecture rationale:** How will you structure your code to be both educational and immediately useful to developers, including those with complex use cases?

### Phase 2: Documentation Development

Create your comprehensive documentation package including:

- Main documentation guide in your preferred format
- GitHub repository with working implementation, code samples, and configuration examples
- Include diagrams, workflow visualizations, screencasts, or process charts as appropriate

We understand that time is tight, so if your plan is ambitious, we encourage you to flesh out the parts that best exemplify your expertise with Claude Code and your skills as a technical documentation engineer. For other sections, you can write placeholder explanations for what you would further develop given more time.

## A Note on Technical Expectations

At Anthropic, our technical documentation engineers work with highly complex production code and receive limited direct engineering support due to team bandwidth. As such, this role requires independently understanding complex production codebases to create accurate documentation. And while your primary output is documentation, you'll need to demonstrate that you can read, understand, and explain sophisticated code architectures without extensive guidance from engineering teams.

The best technical documentation comes from truly understanding the code. Through your implementation examples and explanations, show us that you can:

- Navigate and understand complex, multi-file codebases
- Identify architectural patterns and explain why they matter
- Anticipate where developers will struggle based on code complexity
- Create examples that demonstrate you've grasped non-obvious technical concepts
