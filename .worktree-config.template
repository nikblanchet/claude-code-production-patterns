# Worktree Configuration Template
#
# Copy this file to .worktree-config and customize for your project.
# The git hooks (pre-commit, post-checkout) will read this configuration
# to determine which worktrees are "feature worktrees" vs the "main worktree".
#
# Usage:
#   cp .worktree-config.template .worktree-config
#   # Edit .worktree-config with your project-specific values
#   # Add .worktree-config to .gitignore (it's project-specific)

# WORKTREE_PATTERN: The path pattern that identifies feature worktrees
# Feature worktrees should contain this pattern in their absolute path
# Main worktree should NOT contain this pattern
#
# For bare repos with worktrees as subfolders (main/, feature-x/, etc.):
#   WORKTREE_PATTERN="/"              # Matches any subfolder except bare repo root
#
# For other structures:
#   WORKTREE_PATTERN="-wt-"           # For worktrees like /path/to/project-wt-feature/
#   WORKTREE_PATTERN="/worktrees/"    # For worktrees in /path/to/worktrees/feature/
WORKTREE_PATTERN="/"

# PROJECT_ROOT: Optional. The root directory of your main worktree
# If not set, hooks will auto-detect using git rev-parse --show-toplevel
# PROJECT_ROOT="/Users/username/projects/myproject"

# CREATE_WORKTREE_SCRIPT: Path to the create_worktree.py script
# Relative to the project root, or absolute path
CREATE_WORKTREE_SCRIPT="actual-code/create_worktree.py"
