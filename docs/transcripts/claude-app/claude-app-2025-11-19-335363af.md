 I'll convert this PDF to a markdown file for you.

Done! I've converted the PDF to a well-structured markdown file. The file maintains all the original content and includes:

- Proper markdown heading hierarchy
- Clear section organization
- Formatted lists and emphasis
- Logical flow that matches the original document
- All requirements and guidance intact

The file is saved at `/home/claude/claude_code_takehome.md` and is now portable and easy to work with in any AI tool or markdown editor. You can copy it directly into Claude conversations or other tools without any formatting hassles.
