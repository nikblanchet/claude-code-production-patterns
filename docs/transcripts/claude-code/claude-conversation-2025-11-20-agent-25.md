## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase in `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/repos/custom-claude-skills`. 

I can assist with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code content with regex
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Exploring the structure and relationships in your code

I'm currently on the `docimp/python-worktree-hooks` branch, and I can see there are some recent changes related to worktree scripts and git hooks.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?
