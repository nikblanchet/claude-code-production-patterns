## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and analyze code in this repository. Let me start by getting a quick overview of the project structure.

Let me explore the codebase:

```bash
find /Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main -type f -name "*.py" | head -20
```

```bash
ls -la /Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main
```

I can see this is a Python project with:
- A `uv.lock` file (modified - package management)
- A `bonus/` directory (newly added)
- Recent commits related to Claude Code hooks, agents, and skills

The project appears to be structured around production patterns for Claude Code with:
- Configuration management (likely pyproject.toml or similar)
- Testing setup (pytest)
- Code quality tools (ruff, mypy)

I'm ready to help you search for specific files, functions, patterns, or explore particular areas of the codebase. What would you like me to investigate?
