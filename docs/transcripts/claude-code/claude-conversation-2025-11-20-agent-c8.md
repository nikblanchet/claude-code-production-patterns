## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase. 

I can see I'm working in a git repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns` on the main branch, which appears to be clean with recent commits related to Python project refactoring and infrastructure improvements.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
