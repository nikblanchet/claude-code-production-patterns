## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase! 

Looking at the environment, I can see we're working in a git repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main`. The repo appears to be focused on Claude Code production patterns, with recent commits about hooks, agents, skills, and scenarios.

I'm equipped to:
- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search content** with regex patterns
- **Read files** to analyze code
- **Explore** the repository structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
