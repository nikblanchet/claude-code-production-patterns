## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, and I can help you find files, search code, and analyze the structure of your project.

Based on the environment information, I can see we're working in a repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main`. The repo has:
- A main branch with recent commits about Claude Code hooks, agents, and skills
- Some uncommitted changes to `uv.lock`
- An untracked `bonus/` directory

What would you like me to search for or explore? I can:
- Find files matching specific patterns
- Search for code snippets or text patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase structure

Just let me know what you're looking for!
