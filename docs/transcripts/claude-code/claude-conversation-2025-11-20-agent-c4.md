## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! This appears to be a repository related to Claude Code production patterns, with Python code and documentation.

I can see from the git status that you have:
- Modified files: `.claude/settings.local.json`, `actual-code/create_worktree.py`, and `uv.lock`
- An untracked directory: `.scratch/`

The repository is on the `main` branch, and recent commits show work on assignment prompts, Python tooling with `uv`, infrastructure documentation, and audit improvements.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
