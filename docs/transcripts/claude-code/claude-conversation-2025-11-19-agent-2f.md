## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase. 

I can see you're working in a Claude Code production patterns repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main`. The repo appears to be on the main branch with some modified files and a new `.claude/` directory.

I'm equipped to:
- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search content** with regex-powered grep
- **Read and analyze** specific files
- **Navigate** the codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore?
