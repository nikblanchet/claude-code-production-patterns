## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm set up as a file search specialist for exploring your codebase.

I can see you're in a git repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main` with some uncommitted changes in:
- `actual-code/create_worktree.py`
- `actual-code/skills/user/development-standards/skill.md`
- `uv.lock`
- A new `.claude/` directory

I have access to powerful search tools:
- **Glob** - for finding files by pattern matching
- **Grep** - for searching file contents with regex
- **Read** - for viewing specific file contents
- **Bash** - for read-only operations (ls, git commands, etc.)

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll navigate through the files efficiently to help you find what you need.
