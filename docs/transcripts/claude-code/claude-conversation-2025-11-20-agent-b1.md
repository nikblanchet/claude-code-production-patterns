## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I can help you explore this codebase thoroughly by:

- **Searching for files** using glob patterns
- **Searching file contents** with regex
- **Reading specific files** to analyze code
- **Running read-only bash commands** to understand the repository structure

The repository appears to be at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns` and is currently on the `main` branch with a clean status.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
