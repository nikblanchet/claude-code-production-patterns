## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you explore this codebase. I'm in read-only mode and can help you search for files, examine code, and analyze the repository structure.

I see you're in the `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns` repository on the main branch (which is clean). The repository appears to contain documentation and examples related to Claude Code patterns and best practices.

What would you like to search for or explore in this codebase? I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search for specific content using regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the repository structure

Just let me know what you're looking for!
