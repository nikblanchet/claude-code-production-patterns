## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I can efficiently navigate through files, search for patterns, and analyze code content.

What would you like me to search for or investigate in your repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns`?

Some examples of what I can help with:
- Finding files matching specific patterns
- Searching for code snippets or text across files
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Exploring directory structures
- Searching git history for changes

Just let me know what you need!
