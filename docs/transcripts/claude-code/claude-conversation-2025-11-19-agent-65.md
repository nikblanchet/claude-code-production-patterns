## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase. I can see this is a repository about Claude Code production patterns, currently on the main branch with some modifications to files related to worktrees and Python tooling.

I'm equipped to:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search through code with regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the repository structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
