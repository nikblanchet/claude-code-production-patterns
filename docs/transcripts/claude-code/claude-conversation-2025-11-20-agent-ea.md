## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase. I can see you're working in a git repository at `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns`.

What would you like me to find or search for? I can:
- Search for specific files using patterns (e.g., "find all Python files")
- Search within file contents using regex patterns (e.g., "find all TODO comments")
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the codebase structure

Just let me know what you're looking for!
