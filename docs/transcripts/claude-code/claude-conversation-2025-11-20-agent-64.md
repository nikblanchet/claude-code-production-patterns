## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm here as a file search specialist to help you explore and analyze your codebase.

I can help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code and text with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Understanding your project structure

I'm currently in the `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main/docs` directory, which is part of a git repository on the `main` branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
