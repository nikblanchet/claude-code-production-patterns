## 🤖 Claude

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze this codebase!

I can see you're in the `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main` directory, which is a git repository with some recent activity including Claude Code hooks, agents, and skills additions.

I'm prepared to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Help you navigate and understand the codebase structure

What would you like to explore? I can help you:
- Find specific files or patterns
- Locate code implementations
- Understand file relationships and dependencies
- Search for particular functionality

Just let me know what you're looking for!
