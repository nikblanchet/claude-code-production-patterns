## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! 

I can see you're working in `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns`, which is a clean git repository on the `main` branch with an initial setup including uv, pytest, ruff, and mypy.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? I can:
- Find files matching specific patterns
- Search for code or text content
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the project structure

Just let me know what you need!
