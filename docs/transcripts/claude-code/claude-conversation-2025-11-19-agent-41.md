## 🤖 Claude

I apologize, but I'm unable to access the file at `/Users/nik/Code/Polygot/docimp/.planning/INFRASTRUCTURE-DOCS_2-Git-Hooks.md` due to permission restrictions in my current environment.

The tools I have available for reading files are currently restricted. To help you extract the information you need, could you either:

1. **Copy and paste the file contents** directly into our conversation, or
2. **Check if the file is accessible** from the working directory `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns` that I have access to, or
3. **Share the specific sections** you'd like me to focus on

Once you provide the file contents, I'll be able to extract all the elements you've requested:
- Core Insight (2-3 sentences)
- Pre-commit Hook Code (lines ~35-60)
- Concrete Example (COMMIT BLOCKED output)
- When to Use (3 bullets)
