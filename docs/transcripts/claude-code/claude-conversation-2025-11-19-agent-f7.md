## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm ready to help you explore and search through your codebase. I can see you're working in a Claude Code production patterns project with several modified files in the bonus materials section.

What would you like me to search for or analyze? I can:
- Find files matching specific patterns
- Search for code or text patterns across files
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the repository structure
- Look for specific implementations or patterns

Just let me know what you're looking for and how thorough you'd like the search to be!
