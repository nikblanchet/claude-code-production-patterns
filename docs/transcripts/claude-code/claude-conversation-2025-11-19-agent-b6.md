## 🤖 Claude

Hello! I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase. I can see this is a repository about Claude Code production patterns, with several directories and files related to configuration, hooks, and documentation.

From the git status, I can see:
- Modified files: `ADVANCED_PATTERNS.md`, `PLANNING.md`, `hooks/README.md`
- Deleted files from `claude-config/`, `direnv/`, `hooks/`, and `examples/`
- New untracked files including pattern documentation, diagrams, and an `actual-code/` directory
- Sample hook files in the `hooks/` directory

The working directory is: `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main`

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
