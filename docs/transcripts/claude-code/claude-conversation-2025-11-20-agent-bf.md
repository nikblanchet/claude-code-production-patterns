## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase! 

Looking at the environment:
- **Working directory**: `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main/docs`
- **Git repository**: Yes, on the `main` branch
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 25.1.0)
- **Date**: 2025-11-19

I can see from the git status that there are some modified and untracked files in the parent directory.

I'm equipped to help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex (grep)
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore?
