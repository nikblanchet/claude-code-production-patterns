## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! 

Looking at the environment, I can see we're working in `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns`, which is a git repository on the main branch with a clean status.

The recent commit suggests this is a Python project with:
- uv (Python package installer)
- pytest (testing framework)
- ruff (linter/formatter)
- mypy (type checker)

What would you like me to search for or explore? I can:
- Find specific files or file patterns
- Search for code patterns or text across the codebase
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the project structure

Let me know what you need!
