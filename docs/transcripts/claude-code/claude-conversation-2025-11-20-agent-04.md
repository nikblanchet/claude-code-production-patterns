## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, equipped with powerful tools to navigate and analyze your repository.

I can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore repository structure
- Locate functions, classes, or code patterns

I see you're working in the `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/repos/custom-claude-skills` repository, currently on the `docimp/python-worktree-hooks` branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
