## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in read-only exploration mode.

I can help you:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate and explore your codebase

The repository appears to be a production patterns project with some recent changes:
- Modified: `actual-code/create_worktree.py` and `uv.lock`
- New directory: `.scratch/`
- Recent work includes enforcing `uv run` for Python tools and adding Claude Code infrastructure

Let me know what you'd like to search for or explore in this codebase!
