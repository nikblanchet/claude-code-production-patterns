## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you explore and search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I'm in read-only mode.

I can help you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns to search by filename, extension, or directory structure
- **Search code contents** using powerful regex patterns to locate specific code, functions, variables, or text
- **Read and analyze** specific files once we've located them
- **Navigate your codebase** efficiently and thoroughly

Your current working directory is:
`/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns`

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it!
