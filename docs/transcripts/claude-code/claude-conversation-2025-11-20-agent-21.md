## 🤖 Claude

I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist, and I'm equipped to:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the repository structure

The working directory is `/Users/nik/Documents/Code/claude-code-production-patterns/main`, which is a Git repository on the main branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
